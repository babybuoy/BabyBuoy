	  <h2> Project Summary </h2>
	  <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px; text-align: center;">
	  In our project, we would like to construct a “buoy” like device. Our device includes features such as a sounding alarm to alert
individuals that there may be trouble in the swimming pool. Also, a mobile
application that would be connected through WiFi to inform parents if they happen
to be far from the reach of the sounding alarm. The mobile application would also
contain information such as logs from when the motion was detected, and device
battery life. Our buoy device will be equipped with a water surface sensor. To
maintain and sustain battery life, we will enforce solar capability to convert light
into energy. We would also implement a two-step verification using underwater
visuals, to reduce any false alarms from filters, wind, or any other miscellaneous
objects that might disturb the surface of the water. This underwater vision may be
implemented by having a waterproof camera attached to scan to the bottom of the water.

	  <h2> Our Goal </h2>
	  <p style="font-size: 18px; margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px; text-align: center;">
	  Our goal with this project is to construct a buoy with sensors to alert any parent that
may have curious children that roam near the pool if or when they take a harmful,
unsupervised step into the pool. The main objective of this project is to reduce the
number of child fatalities that occur every year in the sunshine state of Florida.
